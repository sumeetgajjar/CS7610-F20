- please always always always build docker image after making changes to hostfile
- while the container is running the docker logs are best 
- once the container has exited the logs can be found under logs/<container-name>/lab1.INFO file
- to increase the verbosity of logging run with VERBOSE=1; python3 -m unittest test_multicast.MulticastSuite.<testname>
